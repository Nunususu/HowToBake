These cookies have a list of great attributes that I will list from my favorite to least favorite
</p>
<ol>
<li>Exploding with a chocolatey flavor (depending on how much chocolate you use)</li>
<li>Very Tasty</li>
<li>East to make</li>

<p>Every time I use a spoon to move the batter onto the baking sheet my mind is taken aback to a different time, like a grandma looking at a locket given to her by her first boyfriend, when she looks at it she sees herself riding on a motorcycle heading to a diner (because they wanted to eat and it's the only restaurants that existed back then),
   she thinks of how he proposed that one Wednesday night. Her life wouldâ€™ve been perfect if she had just said no, because right after a prince came in for a wife to take back to his magic kingdom but seeing the ring on her finger he assumed she was already married and did ask her to marry him.
    Oh she could have been young forever in the magical kingdom, but alas she's not, she's stuck here forever imagining what could have been.
    Like her I am taken back to a time, that time my brother knocked out my front tooth with a spoon.
